# RPG-Simulator
Simple multi-threaded GUI and RPG simulator created in Java
 
Why are there no commits? I didnâ€™t discover the usefulness of github until months after this project was set aside. I wanted to include it for posterity and to show basic knowledge of Java programming. 
This was a project I began while working through the book Head First Design Patterns. In this I implemented the observable pattern, and made my first attempt at a multi-threaded application. Why is it not fully completed? My initial goal was to get the multi-threaded aspect of it working, and it does. The project continued to grow beyond what was intended and I decided to stop it, without buttoning it up completely to move on to other things. As is, it works with basic random rpg functionality, but the stamina, inventory management and balancing were never fleshed out or completed and likely never will be in this current iteration.
